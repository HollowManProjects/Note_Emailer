Augmenting Paths & Minimum Cuts:

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
You have a directed graph with non-negative edge weights. 
The weights of the edges are called capacities. The easiest 
way to think of them is as pipes that hold water, and the 
capacities represent the diameters of the pipes. Nodes are 
junctions between multiple pipes.
</p>
<p>
There are two special nodes, called the source and the sink 
You assume that there is an infinite source of water at the 
source. The Network Flow problem is as follows:<b> What is the
 maximum amount of water that can flow from the source to the
  sink? No edge can hold more flow than its capacity, and the 
  amount of flow going into a node has to equal the amount of 
  flow going out of a node.</b>
</p>

<h2>A Related Problem: The Minimum Cut</h2>
<p>
A cut of a graph is a collection of edges that disconnects the 
source and the sink. A minimum cut is a cut with the smallest
 total capacity. The maximum flow through a network is f, then 
 the minimum cut has a total capacity of f. For example, in the 
 above graph, the edges AT, BT and CD compose a minimum cut. 
 I'll show you an algorithm for determining the minimum cut 
 later in this lecture.

<h2>Why do we care about this problem?</h2>
<p>
Network flow is a useful to solve a variety of problems that 
most wouldn't think could be solved with this methodology such 
as:
<ul>
    <li>Airline Scheduling</li>
    <li>Leaving a concert after the show ends</li>
    <li>Image Segmentation</li>
    <li>Gene Function Prediction</li>
    <li>Network Reliability</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Ford-Fulkerson (AKA Augmenting Paths) Algorithm</h2>
<p>
The steps to the algorithm are as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Create two graphs. One be a copy of the orginal graph
    (our residual graph), the other being a graph of all the nodes
    with no edges (our flow graph)</li>
    
    <br>
    
    <li>
    We then do the following, until we can no longer find any
    flow from the source to the sink.
    <br>
    <ol>
        <br>
        <li>We add a path from the original graph to the flow 
        graph. The weights of this flow is the minimum edge that 
        is along the path</li>
        
        <br>
        <li>We then subtract that flow path from the residual 
        graph (adding reverse edges). This keeps track of how 
        much flow can still make it to the sink.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Once there is no more paths from the source to the 
    sink. Then we look at all the incoming edges pointing to 
    the sink in the flow graph. That is then our final network 
    flow using Augmented Paths (AKA the max flow that can be 
    pushed through the graph).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Using the Residual Graph to find the Minimum Cut</h2>
<p>
To find the minimum cut, you first find all of the nodes that
 are reachable from the source in the residual graph. Then minimum
 cut is all the edges in the original graph that seperate the 
 nodes reachable from the source vs the ones reachable from the 
 sink.
